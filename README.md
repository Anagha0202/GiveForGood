# GiveForGood
A website to bride gap between NGOs and people in need through Google Maps

<b>Frontend :</b> ReactJS, HTML/CSS, Javascript </br>
<b>Backend :</b> Python </br>
<b>Database :</b> MySQL </br>

Web Application developed during HackForHumanity Hackathon 2023 at Santa Clara University, CA. 
By harnessing the capabilities of Google Maps APIs, developed a solution to empower non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to reach more people in need by tapping into the collective power of the general public.

Users can login using their Google accounts by using OAuth.
Then used Google Maps Javascript API's to display the map which is visible to both users and NGO's. Users can then mark a location on the map and co-ordinates are then stored into the MySQL database. These marked locations are visible only to the NGO's and they now have access to real-time location and data.
